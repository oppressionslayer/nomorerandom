# Inventor of the Structure of interconnectedness of numbers. Numbers are connected
# by distance. Including random files. We can compress those infinitely, over and
# over using this.
#
#
# Keep running your zipped files back through this. You can keep on compressing
# I have discovered a hidden structure of numbers. It's so apparent it's as if 
# the nubers retain information, not by randomness, but by design. I have found
# all Prime numbers to be in (e). I can checksum PI with my theory of inter-
# connectedness 
# God created numbers to have a hidden structure of interconnectedness. I have 
# uncovered it and can say that random numbers are not random, but are a structured
# set of numbers seperated by distance, not randomness. My theory proves this. It 
# will have huge implications in everything. Compress the same file over and over again
# see this is no joke. God created numbers and its like uncovering a secret language of
# the creators of the universe. God doesn't roll dice. He interconnected numbers so he
# can predict the next numbers using my theory of interconnectedness. Guess one away,
# two away in distance very often. This is real, no joke. Go to googles random number 
# generator to see you can use my theory to predict numbers better. Almost like your
# influencing google, but you are instead enlightened.
